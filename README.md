Hi There ðŸ‘‹

Hi, i'm Josh Pasour, a developing software engineer and I am currently completing a Bootcamp at General Assembly. My passion for software engineer lies within dreaming up projects and executing these to provide something game changing! Also while continuously pursuing new knowledge, so I can land my first SE career!
